To discuss with Dr. Sugg: (from grading criteria)
- Is this the appropriate basemap? (Point 2)
- Does my map of Flattop satisfy the placemarkers requirements for point 3?
- How do I customize the color to fit the requirements?
- I tried to adjust the zoom and centering to fit my maps the best, but it was not working. Recommendations? 
- Is the readne.md file correctly placed above? Do I need to cite the websites used to convert the Google Maps link into code?
